                <p>Tabletop Tour is the brainchild of software engineer Kay Holten.</p>
                <p>One day, she realized how tired she was of having to remember all of the cool games she'd had seen advertisements for or had played.</p>
                <p>And, thus, Tabletop Tour was born!</p>
                <p>The site name pays homage to the board game Traveller's Tour Through the United States,
                     which was the first board game published in the United States (in 1822).</p>
                <p>Happy gaming!</p>
